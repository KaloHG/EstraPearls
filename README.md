# EstraPearls
Inspired by PrisonPearl &amp; ExilePearl. However with a bit of an HCF Styled twist. Deathbans!

## Usage
If you kill a player with a pearl in your hotbar, the player will be banned for a certain number of days (7 Days), unless they're freed by their teammates. This adds risk to killing and keeping a player deathbanned, and makes defending your kills a lot more fun.

## Requirements
 * MySQL Server
 * Paper/Spigot 1.12.2
 * CivModCore 1.6.2 (or later)

## Configuration
Fill out proper MySQL server credential values in the default config.
You also need to specify the amount of days a player is deathbanned for.

## Commands
 * /epfree - Frees a pearl in your hand
 * /eplocate - Locates a pearl of your choice
 * /ep - Displays a basic help interface.

**Note: This plugin is unstable and isn't tested very much, expect bugs.**
